# Digital Clock ⏰

This is a digital clock built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, developed as part of my learning journey through a **Udemy** course. It shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating live every second.

### 🚀 Current Features

* Real-time time display
* Minimal and responsive design
* Built with only HTML, CSS, and JS

### 🧱 Current Stage

This is the **Level 1** version of the clock—focused on core functionality and clean layout using basic web technologies.

### 🌟 What's Coming Next

* Theme support (light/dark, retro, matrix)
* Smooth animations and transitions
* Optional time format settings
* And more exciting features in future versions!

Stay tuned—this simple clock is just getting started 😉!!!
